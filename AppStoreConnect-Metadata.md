## Description (4000 chars max)

```
JustForToday is a private, all-in-one life tracker built for people in recovery — and anyone committed to daily growth.

Everything stays on your device. No accounts. No servers. No data collection. Just you and your progress.

SOBRIETY TRACKING
See your clean time at a glance. Days, months, years — displayed clearly on your dashboard. Mark milestones and never lose count.

DAILY HABITS
Build the routines that keep you grounded. Track meditation, meetings, prayer, reading, exercise, or anything else that matters to your program. Watch your streaks grow.

PERSONAL INVENTORY
Reflect on your day with a simple nightly inventory. Capture what went well, what didn't, and what you can do differently tomorrow — right in line with Step 10 practice.

GRATITUDE JOURNAL
Write down what you're grateful for each day. Small shift, big impact.

STOIC REFLECTIONS
Start your morning with a daily reflection rooted in timeless wisdom. A moment of clarity to carry into your day.

DAILY RENEWAL
Set your intentions each morning. Revisit them at night. One day at a time, on purpose.

HARD MOMENT SUPPORT
When cravings or tough emotions hit, open the Hard Moment screen for grounding tools and quick access to your support network.

FASTING TRACKER
Monitor intermittent fasting windows alongside your other daily practices. Health is recovery too.

STEPS & WORKOUTS
Connects to Apple Health to pull your step count and workout data — no manual logging needed.

ANALYTICS
See your consistency over time. Weekly and monthly views help you spot patterns and celebrate progress.

FULLY PRIVATE
Your data lives on your device and nowhere else. Optional iCloud sync keeps your data backed up across your own devices — still never on our servers, because we don't have any.

DARK MODE
Full dark mode support that follows your system setting.

MODULAR DESIGN
Use what serves you. Every feature can be toggled on or off from Settings. Make the app yours.

**Data Not Collected** — the app collects no data. If using iCloud sync, Apple handles that under their own privacy policy. You'll select:

- **Data Not Linked to You**: None

- **Data Collected**: None

*This is a strong selling point. Apple will display "No Data Collected" on your listing.*
